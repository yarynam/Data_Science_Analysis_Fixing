We worked with this repository https://github.com/ldbnr4/BigData_Group4 <br>

We modified original script to answer following questions for public universities only:<br>
1.How does the ranking of the university correspond with admission rate?<br>
2.Is there a correlation between cost of tuition and university ranking?<br>
3.What is the correlation between average SAT score and admission rate?<br>


All new charts for public and private universities are saved in the folder 'charts'.

<h4>Script instructions</h4>
Open the collegeRankingScript_fixed.r file in Rstudio and execute.
