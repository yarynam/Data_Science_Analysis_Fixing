We worked with this repository https://github.com/ldbnr4/BigData_Group4 <br>

We modified original script to answer following question for public universities only:
<ul>
<ol>1.How does the ranking of the university correspond with admission rate?</ol>
<ol>2.Is there a correlation between cost of tuition and university ranking?</ol>
<ol>3.What is the correlation between average SAT score and admission rate?</ol>
</ul>

All new charts for public and private universities are saved in the folder 'charts'

<h4>Script instructions</h4>
Open the collegeRankingScript_fixed.r file in Rstudio and execute.
